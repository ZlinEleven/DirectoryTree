Homework #5 for my CSE214 class. This homework is about creating an operating system terminal shell. Using a ternary tree, we create a file system that contains either directories or files; each directory can have up to three children. This program prompts the user for commands such as make directory, move directory, find path, etc. 

What I learned:
 - Binary (ternary) tree data structure
